# Licensing History

*WPF-Math* was originally a direct port from the [JMathTex project][jmathtex] project written in Java, copyright 2004-2007 Universiteit Gent. *JMathTex* is licensed under the terms of the GPLv2 licence, while WPF-Math is licensed under the terms of the MIT licence.

## Current status

We got a permission from JMathTeX authors to distribute the sources of our C# port and the original resources under the terms of the MIT licence. 

## Historical info

Some of the resources included in WPF-Math (`DefaultTexFont.xml`, `GlueSettings.xml`, `PredefinedTexFormulas.xml`, `TexFormulaSettings.xml`, `TexSymbols.xml`) were directly taken from the JMathTex project. To redistribute these resources under the terms of MIT license, we requested permission from the original authors of JMathTeX. Here is a fragment of our email to the JMathTeX authors (some irrelevant details from the emails are omitted because they were discussing additional technical topics concerning how the resources were initially generated):

> One issue is that our project is licensed under the permissive MIT license, but we're using direct copies of some XML resources from JMathTeX (licensed under the GPL). So, we cannot redistribute these resources under the MIT license (and aren't distributing them currently). Namely these resources are: DefaultTexFont.xml, GlueSettings.xml, PredefinedTexFormulas.xml, TexFormulaSettings.xml, and TexSymbols.xml.

In his reply, Prof. Coolsaet kindly granted us a permission:

We have also requested permission to distribute our C# port under the terms of the MIT licence:

> Having said all of that, I, as the main maintainer of the library, kindly ask you to permit the redistribution of our variant of JMathTeX source code converted to the C# programming language under the terms of the MIT license. Many people rely on the library in their scientific applications (we have 100s of downloads for each published version), and we're very much in trouble right now because of the licensing issues.

Here's the reply of Prof. Coolsaet:

> We have no problem with you redistributing your variant of JMathTeX (as
